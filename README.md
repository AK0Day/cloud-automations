# cloud-security-automations
End to end cloud security automations for everyday ops and cyber tasks
In this repository, I showcase automations I’ve developed using **Bash, Azure CLI, Python, and PowerShell**. These scripts are designed to help automate daily tasks Azure engineers and cloud security professionals face, with a strong focus on **security and best practices**.

The automations in this repo include:
- **Infrastructure provisioning**: Storage accounts, Key Vaults, managed identities, etc.
- **Security hardening**: enforcing RBAC, encryption, TLS settings, and secure defaults.
- **Defensive integrations**: pairing Azure with monitoring and file integrity tools (e.g., Wazuh) for detection and response.

My goal with this project is to build a growing collection of reusable automations that make securing cloud environments faster, repeatable, and auditable.
